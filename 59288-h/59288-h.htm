<h2 id="c1">French Painting: 19th Century</h2>
<p>The story of French painters during the nineteenth
century is an exciting one, colored by personal rivalries
and revolutions in taste. In the face of an indifferent or
jeering public, artists often had to make great sacrifices
to achieve the sincere expression of their ideals. Firmly
established academic painters bitterly opposed all young
artists who tried to create new styles, and the inertia of
popular taste lent such authority to the Academy that
artists could only be original at their own peril.</p>
<p>The academic style grew out of the classical idealism
of Jacques-Louis David (<a href="#Page_13">page 13</a>). He rose to fame during
the French Revolution (1789-95) by producing pictures
with propaganda content and attained great
prominence as &ldquo;the painter of the people.&rdquo; Son of a Paris
tradesman, David had been fortunate enough to study
painting in the French Royal Academy. After four failures
and an attempted suicide, he won the <i>Prix de Rome</i>
and in 1774 was able to go to Italy, which was then
considered the fountainhead of art. There, during a ten-year
stay, he reacted violently against the gay, trivial
style of painting that French aristocrats had loved. Idolizing
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
the ancient statues he saw in Rome, he introduced
a powerful Neo-Classical style and, after his return to
France, he reorganized the Academy to sanction only a
sober and &ldquo;elevating&rdquo; imitation of classical art. When
Napoleon became emperor, in 1804, he appointed
David his court painter and commissioned a series of
huge pictures illustrating imperial ceremonies. However,
soon after the Bourbon monarchy was restored, in
1814, David was exiled to Brussels, where he spent his
last years.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s style was continued and refined by his pupil
J.-A.-Dominique Ingres (<a href="#Page_15">page 15</a>), whose father was a
painter at Montauban. Ingres&rsquo; apprenticeship with
David and eighteen years spent in Italy led Ingres to
paint with precise, sculpturesque draftsmanship and
coldly calculated color. To sustain the classical tradition,
his subjects were usually drawn from mythology and
ancient history. After he returned to Paris, in 1824,
Ingres&rsquo; ideal of perfectionism came to dominate academic
art.</p>
<p>Behind it the Academy had the weight of traditionally
accepted theory and the splendid accomplishments
of the Old Masters. The theory, growing from ancient
classical concepts of art, seemed infallible and, on such
a theoretical basis, the five hundred years preceding
the nineteenth century had produced an extremely impressive
art. Imitation of idealized figures was the chief
aim of the academic painter. By showing nature &ldquo;as it
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
ought to be,&rdquo; the artist served philosophical and ethical
ends; he could educate mankind by painting morally
improving illustrations of heroic deeds. On this premise
art had been raised during the Renaissance from a
handicraft to rank with the liberal arts. Academies had
arisen to prove the merits of art, and why should such
august institutions be challenged?</p>
<p>But even in the early years of the century artists revolted
against the academic limitations. Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix
(<a href="#Page_17">page 17</a>) was the central figure in the opposing
Romantic movement. Son of a prefect of Marseilles,
Delacroix began painting in 1813 as an amateur in a
Parisian academic studio. Soon new sensuous richness
of coloring and a feeling of lively movement entered
Delacroix&rsquo;s pictures to express strong emotions. His art
reveals new psychological penetration; as he said, addressing
his fellow artists, &ldquo;Anything can be a subject.
The real subject is yourself; it is your impressions, your
emotions before nature. You must search within yourself,
not look about you.&rdquo; Delacroix&rsquo;s life was embittered
by the jealous rivalry of Ingres, who called him
&ldquo;the apostle of ugliness&rdquo; and prevented him from teaching
in the Academy, but his daring use of color was to
influence many later painters.</p>
<p>In the Romantic era, nature, which had been neglected
as long as the classical tradition prevailed, was
extolled by poets and painted by outstanding masters.
Camille Corot (<a href="#Page_19">page 19</a>), son of a Parisian milliner, became
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
a leading landscapist. Although his teachers were
academicians, admirers of Poussin and Ingres, Corot
turned to his own fresh experiences of nature. As a
Romantic, he saw the world about him passionately.
&ldquo;While imitating conscientiously,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I never for
a moment lose the emotion which first caught my interest.&rdquo;
At times Corot painted with the group of artists
who worked at Barbizon near the Forest of Fontainebleau,
or sometimes he traveled in Italy, Switzerland,
Holland, and England, but usually he was content to
stay with his parents in Paris or at their summer home
in Ville d&rsquo;Avray. Versatile in his art, he combined elements
of classical composition with romantic feeling
and realistic vision.</p>
<p>Corot&rsquo;s breadth of taste allowed him to see the importance
of paintings by Daumier, whom he saved from
neglect and poverty. Honor&eacute; Daumier (<a href="#Page_21">page 21</a>), after
serving as a bailiff&rsquo;s clerk and a librarian, was trained as
a lithographer and turned to political and social caricature.
In the Paris journals, his lithographs, lampooning
prominent figures, exposing graft, and making fun of
the <i>bourgeoisie</i>, were intensely popular. Politics had
been uppermost in French minds after the Revolution
and times were very unsettled. Two civil revolutions in
1830 and 1848 were followed by invasion during the
Franco-Prussian War in 1870. During this time the government
swerved precariously from monarchy to republic,
to empire, and back to republic. The turbulence of
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
these years together with daily human follies was the
material of Daumier&rsquo;s striking cartoons. His paintings,
largely made for personal satisfaction, dwelt on the
hardships of life in the growing industrial city or, in a
lighter vein, on artists, connoisseurs, and circus performers.
With his interest in the life about him, Daumier
was drawn from Romanticism to Realism.</p>
<p>Among artists, dissatisfaction was growing ever
stronger against the implausible gods and heroes
painted by academicians and also against the escapist
tendency of the Romantics, who loved to paint exotic
scenes, removed from ordinary experience. The increasing
materialism and scientific objectivity of the nineteenth
century demanded a realistic style. The role of
leader in the Realist school was taken by Gustave
Courbet (<a href="#Page_23">page 23</a>). This big, boisterous son of a wealthy
farmer in Ornans came to Paris in 1842. After a few lessons,
Courbet taught himself to paint, chiefly by copying
in the Louvre galleries. His large, coarsely executed
pictures of common people shocked most of his contemporaries.
When his work was refused at the International
Exhibition of 1855, he opened his own pavilion,
boldly titling it &ldquo;<i>Le Pavillon du R&eacute;alisme</i>.&rdquo; Among his
best-known sayings are, &ldquo;Painting should consist only
in the depiction of things visible and tangible to the
artist,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Show me an angel, and <i>then</i> I&rsquo;ll paint it.&rdquo;
His outspoken nature led him to embroil himself in politics
after the Franco-Prussian War. Finally, to escape
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
imprisonment he fled to Switzerland, where he spent
his last years in exile.</p>
<p>Both Daumier&rsquo;s and Courbet&rsquo;s realism depended
upon their acceptance of everyday subjects as worthy
of being painted. But realism could be manifest, too, in
meticulous attention to details. Henri Fantin-Latour
(<a href="#Page_25">page 25</a>), a friend of our American painter Whistler, exhibits
this exacting realism in portraits and still-life pictures.
Strongly influenced by the early developments in
photography, he produced works which, because they
were pleasant and unassuming, were often shown at the
annual <i>Salon</i> beside the conservative paintings of approved
academicians. In 1863, however, he found himself
with the young &ldquo;rebels&rdquo; who were allowed to exhibit
only at the <i>Salon des Refus&eacute;s</i>, and he began then to associate
with the more advanced artists.</p>
<p>&Eacute;douard Manet (<a href="#Page_27">page 27</a>) was probably more influential
as a realist than even Courbet. His father, a Paris magistrate,
offered him a choice between studying law and
joining the merchant marine. After a try at the latter,
in 1857 he was allowed to take up painting. Ironically
he was warned by his academic teacher that unless he
gave up his common subjects, he &ldquo;would be only the
Daumier of painting.&rdquo; His boldly painted, unorthodox
canvases stirred great controversy, were defended by
Emile Zola, the realistic novelist, and brought new
courage to other artists who sought to escape from academic
dullness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Manet associated with a number of young artists who
became known as Impressionists after a group exhibition
in 1874. One of them, Claude Monet (<a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>), displayed
a picture called <i>Impression, Sunrise</i>, and a newspaper
critic, vastly amused at its sketchy style and at
the similar sketchiness of the other pictures in the
exhibit, jeered that these artists were not painters at all,
but &ldquo;impressionists.&rdquo; The name stuck to the group because
it so aptly characterized their intentions. Their
aim was to catch a fresh impression of nature in their
pictures. Monet was the leading figure in Impressionism,
which developed in the 1870&rsquo;s and &rsquo;80&rsquo;s. Son of a grocer
in Le Havre, he was doing clever caricatures at the age
of fifteen. He began to paint landscapes with a fellow
artist, Boudin, who taught him to be aware of special
effects of outdoor lighting. Going to Paris in 1863, he
attended academic classes but usually stayed only long
enough to answer roll call. Then he would be off to the
city&rsquo;s outskirts to paint nature instead of ancient heroes.
Often he lured others with him, and Impressionism was
born in the friendly competition of Monet, Renoir, Bazille,
and Sisley. Soon they were joined by others, among
them Camille Pissarro and Berthe Morisot. For many
years they sought understanding for their works. Monet,
who alone pursued Impressionism to its ultimate possibilities
by painting vivid sensations of light, suffered abject
poverty. Only in his last years was his art recognized
and internationally imitated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Few of the other Impressionists analyzed light as
Monet did; they contented themselves with sketchy
brush strokes which seemed to dissolve their forms in
light. Berthe Morisot (<a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>), for example, followed
Manet rather than Monet. After six years of study with
Corot, she met Manet while they were both copying
pictures in the Louvre. A strong friendship developed
between Manet and the Morisot family. Berthe became
his pupil and soon afterward married his brother. Her
crisp, delicate brushwork is a feminine version of
Manet&rsquo;s bold style.</p>
<p>Auguste Renoir (<a href="#cover">cover illustration</a> and <a href="#Page_42">page 42</a>), whose
glowing colors rivaled Monet&rsquo;s, was among the first to
outgrow Impressionism. This son of a Limoges tailor was
earning his living at thirteen in Paris by painting flowers
on china. He saved enough money to attend an
academy and met Monet, with whom he often painted
along the banks of the Seine. But by about 1883 he
found he &ldquo;had wrung Impressionism dry.&rdquo; He regretted
the loss of form, composition, and human values in the
shimmering Impressionist pictures. Setting himself
again to paint forms solidly in space, he nevertheless
retained the brilliant colors of Impressionism.</p>
<p>Sometimes exhibiting with the Impressionists, Edgar
Degas (<a href="#Page_33">page 33</a>) was strongly influenced by their coloring
and used it in realistic scenes of Paris life, the race
track, and the opera ballet. Degas, son of a wealthy
banker, received a thorough classical education and
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
learned painting from a pupil of Ingres. In his compositions,
he preserved a classical sense of order which
was quite foreign to Impressionist aims. As he said, &ldquo;No
art was ever less spontaneous than mine. What I accomplish
is the result of reflection upon and study of
the old masters....&rdquo; Yet he reshaped conventional ideas
of composition by drawing his subjects from life and
refining his outlines after the example of Japanese prints.
These Oriental colored woodcuts, which also influenced
Manet, Whistler, and many others, came to Paris first as
wrapping in boxes of china; they were discovered by
painters, who found inspiration in their simple lines
and decorative flat areas of color.</p>
<p>Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (<a href="#Page_35">page 35</a>), like Degas, saw
his pictures as both realistic and decorative. As a delicate
boy of fourteen he injured both his legs so that
they failed to grow. His father, Count Alphonse de Toulouse,
had no patience with his weakling heir, but his
mother encouraged him to paint. In 1885 he turned his
back upon the academic style and, taking hints from the
free brushwork of the Impressionists and from Japanese
designs, Lautrec began to paint his pictures of Parisian
night life, circus performers, and cabaret entertainers.
Degas, at first hostile toward him, eventually declared,
&ldquo;Well, Lautrec, I can see you are one of our trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vincent van Gogh (<a href="#Page_37">page 37</a>) was a Dutchman who
came to Paris in 1886 and met the Impressionists. He
possessed a deep sincerity, but also had a difficult, flaring
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
temper which alienated many people. After working
unsuccessfully as a picture dealer, a tutor, and a lay
preacher, he turned to art as a means of expressing his
passionate emotions. At first he used dark, somber colors
like those of his countryman Rembrandt; then seeing the
Impressionists&rsquo; canvases, he adopted their brilliant colors.
But their painting of merely optical impressions
could not satisfy his urge for emotional expression.
While he borrowed their bright palette, he used colors
for emotional effects, and in his hands the broken brushwork
became a nervous, intensely expressive agent to
record his inner feelings. His whole remarkable career
as an artist fell within the ten years before 1890, when
he shot himself to escape insanity.</p>
<p>His friend Paul Gauguin (<a href="#Page_39">page 39</a>) shared similar artistic
aims. A wealthy Parisian stockbroker, Gauguin
gave up his business and deserted his family because he
felt compelled to paint. After living for a time in Brittany,
he went to Tahiti and broke entirely with Impressionism.
He formed a style in which his experiences and
feelings were symbolized by intense colors and sweeping
outlines. His art, which anticipates twentieth-century
trends, was incomprehensible to his contemporaries,
and he died impoverished in the Marquesas.</p>
<p>Paul C&eacute;zanne (<a href="#Page_41">page 41</a>), too, is a forerunner of the
moderns. Born at Aix-en-Provence, this banker&rsquo;s son followed
his school friend Zola to Paris. Although an extremely
shy youth he soon married a model and for a
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
time painted and exhibited with the Impressionists.
But, constantly rebuffed by critics and even scorned by
Zola, who failed to see any promise in his forceful early
works, C&eacute;zanne withdrew to live in Provence during
the 1880&rsquo;s and perfected his individual style. His methods
paved the way for the abstract painting of our own
day. In his old age a number of young artists and critics
sought him out and he enjoyed a small degree of recognition
within his lifetime. His work, together with that
of Manet, Monet, Degas, Lautrec, van Gogh, and Gauguin,
has become the most popular painting today.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="sc">Jacques-Louis David</span> (1748-1825)
<br /><i>Napoleon in His Study</i>
<br /><span class="smaller"><i>Samuel H. Kress Collection</i></span></h2>
<p>Remarkably free from the allegorical pomposity of most
official portraits, this picture presents Napoleon I with reserved
dignity. The emperor himself approved it and, upon
its completion in 1812, complimented David. Dressed in his
favorite costume, the uniform of the <i>chasseur de la garde</i>
with a general&rsquo;s epaulettes, Napoleon wears the Legion of
Honor and the Order of the Iron Cross, which commemorates
his earlier coronation as king of Italy. He seems to have
just risen from his desk, on which lies the <i>Code Napol&eacute;on</i>,
the codification of French law which he promulgated.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s style is at its best in portraiture. Combining
realism with a classicist&rsquo;s respect for human dignity, he
shows Napoleon in a characteristic pose but with an air of
grandeur. David&rsquo;s assured touch gives authority to the
work by its incisive, strong handling of details. The composition
is severely rectilinear; framing the figure, vertical
lines descend through the pilaster and table leg at the left
and, again, from the clock through Napoleon&rsquo;s arm and the
leg of the chair. Against these, horizontal lines, marked by
the book shelves, wall molding, and desk, lend compositional
stability. The diagonal lines of the chair are countered
by the diagonal arrangement of the map and book on
the floor. Before this orderly grid of lines Napoleon&rsquo;s figure
appears subtly animated.</p>

<br /><i>Madame Moitessier</i>
<br /><span class="smaller"><i>Samuel H. Kress Collection</i></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Never has beauty more regal, more splendid, more superb,
and of a type more Junoesque yielded its proud contours
to the sensitive drawing of an artist.&rdquo; So the poet
Th&eacute;ophile Gautier described Ingres&rsquo; first portrait of Madame
Moitessier. But Ingres destroyed it because the lady&rsquo;s
daughter, who was included, would not stand still for him.
He produced this second picture in 1851, after six months
of careful work. It perfectly embodies both his exacting perfectionism
and French elegance during the Second Republic.</p>
<p>Ingres was seventy-one years old when he painted this.
Evidently he admired Madame Moitessier, for she was one
of the very few people he consented to paint in his latter
years. He dreaded the arduous demands he imposed upon
himself when doing a portrait. &ldquo;Art is never nearer perfection,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;than when it resembles nature so closely
that it might be mistaken for nature itself.&rdquo; Yet for Ingres,
nature had to be refined through the classical tradition of
art, and he sought to cast Madame Moitessier in the form
of an ideal figure by Raphael. Despite astonishing realism
in the hair with its flowers, in the lace and the jewelry, our
eyes move over graceful Raphaelesque curving lines, which
dominate the face and figure. By such means Ingres strove
to unite the real and the ideal.</p>

<br /><i>Columbus and His Son at La R&aacute;bida</i>
<br /><span class="smaller"><i>Chester Dale Collection</i></span></h2>
<p>In 1491 Columbus, despairing of Spanish support for his
voyage of exploration, was on his way to seek aid in France
when he and his son Diego stopped at the monastery of La
R&aacute;bida, near Huelva, in southern Spain. Delacroix shows
them resting here after their exhausting journey. Columbus
gazes thoughtfully at a map, while the prior, Juan Perez,
behind him, is about to welcome him. Perez, who had been
Queen Isabella&rsquo;s confessor, was able to arrange a royal interview
for Columbus so that ships and men were secured
for the adventure.</p>
<p>Delacroix painted this in 1838, after a trip through Spain.
Evidently the air of quiet mystery in a Spanish monastery
caught his fancy, and he recreates it here. Unlike the Neo-Classicists,
the Romantic Delacroix does not attempt to define
his subjects exactly. In his painting, vague, suggestive
forms are used to stimulate the imagination. His composition
is not a linear design; it is spatial; and our interest is
drawn into the space of this room to discover the whispered
confidences of the monks, the mystery of dark corridors, and
the kind reception of the weary travelers. Delacroix sought
a &ldquo;silent power which speaks alone to the eyes and gains
and conquers all the faculties of the spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>Ville d&rsquo;Avray</i>
<br /><span class="smaller"><i>Gift of Count Cecil Pecci-Blunt</i></span></h2>
<p>With clean, luminous colors Corot has shown a serene
view near his summer home, at Ville d&rsquo;Avray. His father had
bought a house in this small village a few miles west of
Paris, and Corot often returned to it throughout his long
life. Painted when he was in his seventies, this picture
seems to epitomize the development of Corot&rsquo;s style. The
simple buff and terra-cotta planes, which emphasize the
cubic construction of the distant buildings, recall his early
works, especially those painted in Italy between 1825 and
1828. After 1850 he evolved his most popular style, with its
predominant silver-gray hues. Gentle, diffuse outdoor light
gives harmony in these pictures to misty greens and watery
blues, and the trees take on a feathery softness. A few
touches of reddish hue complement the cool colors. All of
these qualities are apparent in this late picture.</p>
<p>Corot conceived his paintings broadly in form and value.
&ldquo;I am never in a hurry to determine details,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the
masses and general character of a picture concern me above
all.&rdquo; He also sought to preserve his emotions about nature:
&ldquo;What we feel is indeed real. Before a subject, we are
moved by a certain elegant grace. Never lose sight of that in
looking for exactness and detail.&rdquo; The mood he suggests is a
romantic reverie upon the subtle colors and serenity of
nature.</p>

<br /><i>Advice to a Young Artist</i>
<br /><span class="smaller"><i>Gift of Duncan Phillips</i></span></h2>
<p>Daumier&rsquo;s broad planes of deep, vibrant color and his
roughly applied highlights struck most of his contemporaries
as preposterously crude. His paintings were astonishingly
daring for an era which looked for meretricious fidelity
to nature in its pictures. Few could grasp the significance of
his simple, massive forms or understand how his profound
human sympathy made these forms expressive symbols of
emotion. In this picture a mood, sympathetic and quiet, is
established between the young man and his master as they
discuss a sketch selected from the big portfolio.</p>
<p>For the eye sensitive to color and value, there is a remarkable
satisfaction in Daumier&rsquo;s choice of hues. How deftly he
contrasts the cool, shadowed paper in the old man&rsquo;s hands
with the warm white of the sheets below, yet how nicely
distinguished the grayish paper is from the gray smock of
the young man! These cool hues reappear, echoed in the
background, to climax in the blue portfolio which rests
against the red couch. The starkly simple, brown-clad old
man stands out against the cool colors about him. On his
face a few details, boldly indicated in dark lines and planes
of light, strengthen the picture&rsquo;s emotional content. Such a
composition has qualities analogous to the majestic movements
of a symphony.</p>

<br /><i>La Grotte de la Loue</i>
<br /><span class="smaller"><i>Gift of Charles L. Lindemann</i></span></h2>
<p>Below a three-hundred-foot perpendicular cliff in the
Jura mountains, the Loue River issues in cascades from a
cavernous grotto and flows through Courbet&rsquo;s native town,
Ornans, to join the Doubs and ultimately swell the Sa&ocirc;ne.
Courbet, who loved his native scenery, does not choose to
paint the picturesque aspects of this fine scene. Instead he
looks with new intensity at nature and places his unprecedented,
forthright vision almost brutally on canvas. Having
little patience with refinements of draftsmanship, he seems
to have used the thick body of his generously applied paint
to counterfeit reality in his picture. While light and shade
are present, Courbet is unconventional in his modeling of
the great rocks. The eye is often uncertain of the surfaces
of these rocks; their directions in space are ill-defined and
one form is not connected with another. But viewing the
work broadly, we are conscious of the painter&rsquo;s power. How
solidly the man spearing a fish stands before the opening of
the spacious cavern and how substantially the huge masses
of rock swell forward from the darkness! With his powerful,
unorthodox style, Courbet broke radically with traditional
modes of painting &ldquo;to transcribe,&rdquo; as he said, &ldquo;the customs,
ideas, the appearances,&rdquo; of his time, &ldquo;in a word, to create
a living art.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>Still Life</i>
<br /><span class="smaller"><i>Chester Dale Collection</i></span></h2>
<p>A careful rendering of objects selected for their varied
colors, shapes, and textures and neatly arranged on a table
top is a perfect vehicle for the display of Fantin-Latour&rsquo;s
technical facility. A companion of artists with such diverse
tastes as Ingres, Delacroix, Corot, Courbet, and Whistler,
he created a delicate art which appealed to all. The objects
in this still life have been skillfully placed on the table to
establish a self-contained pictorial composition. The book is
turned at an angle to lead the eye back towards the vase of
flowers, which forms a climax for the picture. The bald
shape of the book is artfully interrupted by the silhouette
of the dainty cup; and the tray, overlapping the table edge,
also relieves the monotony of too straight a line. For the
same reason the fruits overlap the tray and basket. Further
variety is given by the careful distinction of various textures.
Like a Dutch Old Master, Fantin-Latour has included
a peeled orange to let him display his cleverness in showing
textural variety, and he has dwelt lovingly on the petals of
the flowers. Such a picture conservatively retains much of
the academic style; it was composed on the table top before
it was ever painted, and it should be distinguished from the
work of Fantin-Latour&rsquo;s more progressive friends.</p>

<br /><i>Gare Saint-Lazare</i>
<br /><span class="smaller"><i>Gift of Horace Havemeyer in memory of his mother Louisine W. Havemeyer</i></span></h2>
<p>As chic as a fashion plate, Manet&rsquo;s picture shows how he
reacted against the academy and found a fresh style to
paint the life of his times. The fashionable young woman is
Victorine Meurend, Manet&rsquo;s favorite model, whom he
painted in <i>The Picnic</i> and <i>Olympia</i>, where his bold treatment
of the nude figure shocked or entertained most of
Paris. The little girl was the daughter of a friend, in whose
garden Manet painted the picture. The child looks through
the iron railing, evidently fascinated by a train that has
pulled into the Saint-Lazare station in Paris. Obligingly the
train has left behind it a cloud of white smoke which obliterates
unwanted detail from the background so that
Manet can arrange the figures in a handsome pattern against
the regular intervals of the railing.</p>
<p>Like the Impressionists Manet used light colors and, by
suppressing shadows, he secured the effect of bright, outdoor
lighting. While he satisfies the Realist&rsquo;s love for an apparently
casual composition, with its figures off-center and
&ldquo;unposed,&rdquo; actually he has sensitively composed them according
to principles learned from Japanese prints. As in the
Oriental woodcuts, here, too, broad silhouettes of contrasting
colors lend the picture its sparkle, while graceful curving
contours in the figures and costumes form a pleasing
design.</p>

years after the first Impressionist exhibition, this picture reveals
Monet&rsquo;s ultimate achievement in capturing sunlight
with broken color. The myriad glowing spots of color almost
dissolve the cathedral&rsquo;s form. Small, separate touches of
paint, prismatic in their brilliance, complement each other
to dazzle the eye and suggest the shimmer of actual light.
Monet painted an extensive series of pictures showing different
effects of light playing across the elaborate Gothic
tracery of Rouen Cathedral. He said that often he could
paint on each picture for only two or three minutes at a
time; after that, the light would have changed and, for him,
the subject would become quite different.</p>
<p>Monet created a new kind of pictorial unity. It did not
depend upon lines or patterns, but upon the unity of a
single visual sensation, an impression. He gave up such traditional
aims as balancing his composition or expressing
emotions about his subjects. Instead he painted vivid optical
sensations. Through long experience he had discovered
what effects of light might be achieved by juxtaposing certain
bright, pure colors which interplay, one against another,
to simulate the visual experience of light. As C&eacute;zanne said,
&ldquo;Monet was only an eye, but what an eye!&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>In the Dining Room</i>
<br /><span class="smaller"><i>Chester Dale Collection</i></span></h2>
<p>Characteristically feminine in her choice of subject and
delicacy of coloring, Berthe Morisot has painted an interior
of the house at Bougival, near Paris, where she spent her
summers in the 1880&rsquo;s. Probably it is her housemaid, busy in
the dining room, who stands between the open cupboard
and the table. A playful little dog adds a touch of animation
to the domestic scene.</p>
<p>During the middle of her career, Berthe Morisot was
strongly influenced by Impressionism. In this picture particular
details of the furniture, of the girl&rsquo;s costume, or
even of her face, held interest for the painter only in so far
as they reflected light in different ways. Much as it does in
Monet&rsquo;s art, light seems to fill the scene and blur the edges
of the forms. Yet, as in Manet&rsquo;s pictures, the colors here
have not the daring brilliance of the spectrum hues Monet
used. Berthe Morisot has sustained a refined color harmony
of delicate warm and cool hues in the blue-grays and
creamy highlights. Her composition, too, shows her allegiance
to Manet rather than to Monet; the forms are
broadly seen in silhouette so that light and shadow do not
impinge upon them enough to destroy their character as
elements in the design.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><span class="sc">Edgar Degas</span> (1834-1917)
<br /><i>Four Dancers</i>
<br /><span class="smaller"><i>Chester Dale Collection</i></span></h2>
<p>Before a colorful stage set, four ballerinas are awaiting
their cue to perform. Dancers were among Degas&rsquo; most frequent
subjects. Because the forms of their flaring skirts and
bodices were simple, he could arrange them easily into
handsome patterns and make them colorful by the artificial
richness of stage lighting. He sketched the ballet dancers
frequently during their exhausting hours of rehearsal and
again in their spritely performances at the Paris Opera.</p>
<p>Though Degas shared interests with both Realists and
Impressionists, he cannot be classified simply as either. His
art synthesized several trends; he merged the academic
and the progressive styles. Firmly grounded in the academic
manner, he used precise outlines, which were foreign
to the Realist or Impressionist. In this picture, his lines describe
the ballerinas&rsquo; heads, arms and costumes and also
establish an intricate design of diagonals moving back into
depth. While the extreme off-center balance of the composition
gives a realistic &ldquo;snap-shot&rdquo; view, it also heightens
our awareness of the design so that the eye enjoys the
variety of shapes and colors. Though the colors are applied
with Impressionistic freedom, they combine into a vibrant
harmony typical of Degas&rsquo; late style. Very fond of this picture,
Degas kept it in his studio until his death.</p>

<h2 id="c13"><span class="sc">Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec</span> (1864-1901)
<br /><i>Quadrille at the Moulin Rouge</i>
<br /><span class="smaller"><i>Chester Dale Collection</i></span></h2>
<p>In tones of green and copper Toulouse-Lautrec has captured
the tawdry gaiety of Montmartre&rsquo;s most colorful night
spot in the gay &rsquo;nineties. The Moulin Rouge, despite its
name, was never a windmill; it is a dance hall which uses
the sails of a mill for advertising. Lautrec frequented it because
he enjoyed watching the nightly performances of its
spirited dancers. Their specialty, the quadrille, grew out of
the high-kicking cancan; almost as vigorous, it was even
more complicated. Dominating the scene here, Gabrielle, a
popular professional dancer, has hoisted her skirts as she
lines up with the others to begin the dance. With telling
outline, Lautrec characterizes her robust physique and hoydenish
air. She is in sharp contrast to the woman facing her,
in the foreground, whom Lautrec has shown as delicately
refined.</p>
<p>Admiring Manet, Morisot, and especially Degas, Lautrec
produced handsome compositions similar to theirs. Again,
under the influence of Japanese prints, light and shadow
have disappeared, replaced by bold color patterns and
strong lines. But Lautrec was far more concerned with
characterization than were the other painters of his time
and, like Daumier in an earlier generation, he gives a wonderfully
vivid picture of his age.</p>

<br /><i>La Mousm&eacute;</i>
<br /><span class="smaller"><i>Chester Dale Collection</i></span></h2>
<p>Loving the delicacy of Japanese art and having read
about Japan, van Gogh named this young girl a &ldquo;mousm&eacute;.&rdquo;
The word was taken from a romantic novel by Pierre Loti,
who used it in describing the charm of the young Japanese
tea-house attendants. Actually this subject was a peasant
of Provence, in southern France. Van Gogh went there in
1888 hoping to capture in its bright sunshine some of the
beauty he imagined in Japan.</p>
<p>With a very personal interpretation of Japanese style,
he has shown this figure in a bold pattern of startling,
bright colors. Earlier in Paris he had learned the color theories
which Neo-Impressionists were applying to painting,
and here his green, orange red, and intense blue are used
with the purity that characterizes them in the spectrum.
The Neo-Impressionists juxtaposed very small touches of
such pure colors in order to suggest light even brighter than
the Impressionists had achieved. But van Gogh was disinterested
in effects of natural lighting. In this picture the
girl is like a figure in an icon. Set against the plain, intense
green background, she seems to be isolated from commonplace
experience, and we are reminded of van Gogh&rsquo;s stated
aim, &ldquo;I wish to paint men and women with that quality of
the eternal which used to be suggested by the halo and
which we attempt to give by the pure radiance and vibration
of the colors.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>Fatata te Miti</i>
<br /><span class="smaller"><i>Chester Dale Collection</i></span></h2>
<p><i>Fatata te Miti</i> means simply &ldquo;by the sea,&rdquo; but what a
curious vision Gauguin&rsquo;s imagination has created from this
scene of two Tahitian girls on the beach! The artist has
found himself in a disquieting, primeval world where rich
tropical colors and exotic forms of life, both human and
vegetable, engender a haunting air of mystery. Gauguin
painted this in 1892, during his second year in Tahiti. He
had fled from Western civilization for he believed its materialistic
culture rejected the artist as a useful citizen. He
turned to the Pacific islands because he felt the need to become
a primitive in both life and art. Only by returning to
the primitive&rsquo;s simple standards might man rediscover significant
meaning in his life and work.</p>
<p>The almost forgotten religion of the Maori cult stirred
Gauguin&rsquo;s mind to prodigious creative activity. Lingering
superstitions delighted him; phosphorescent fungi on the
trees glowing in the twilight, as he painted them here, were
thought to represent the spirits of long dead ancestors. In
his art he evolved an expressive symbolism. He spoke of
&ldquo;the music of the picture,&rdquo; a &ldquo;magic accord&rdquo; of the colors
and arabesque patterns, which &ldquo;addresses itself to the most
intimate part of the soul.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>Still Life</i>
<br /><span class="smaller"><i>Chester Dale Collection</i></span></h2>
<p>Against rigid horizontal and vertical lines in the background,
C&eacute;zanne has juxtaposed the curves of apples, bottles,
and folds of drapery in turbulent, sweeping lines. He
delighted in painting still-life subjects, for here were things
that, unlike people, did not want to move but remained uncomplainingly
motionless during the long hours, even days,
that C&eacute;zanne needed for his intensive, exacting studies.</p>
<p>Realizing that Impressionists sacrificed the pictorial structure
he admired in the Old Masters&rsquo; works, C&eacute;zanne took
the formless touches of the Impressionists&rsquo; broken color and
made each brush stroke a distinct &ldquo;little plane.&rdquo; In an apple,
for example, he realized its form and color by integrating
these small modulating planes of color so that the apple
appears solid, round, and glowing with light. Yet C&eacute;zanne
was aiming beyond simply reproducing the appearance of
an apple. He strove for a total form in which every brush
stroke in his composition is integrated. Every touch of paint,
like a link in a chain, must contribute to the consistent
unity of the picture. He believed a picture should give a
unified sensation in which &ldquo;every color-touch must contain
air, light, the object, the plane, the character, the drawing,
the style.&rdquo; By abstracting nature into the painter&rsquo;s colored
planes, C&eacute;zanne paved the way for the abstract styles of
the present century.</p>

<h2 id="c17"><span class="sc">Auguste Renoir</span> (1841-1919)
<br /><i>A Girl with a Watering Can</i> <span class="small">(<i>Illustrated on <a href="#cover">cover</a></i>)<br />Canvas. 39&frac12; &times; 28&frac34; inches. Dated 1876</span>
<br /><span class="smaller"><i>Chester Dale Collection</i></span></h2>
<p>This picture of a very dressed-up little girl, who has been
watering flowers in her garden, inherits the long tradition
of appealing children&rsquo;s portraits which have been well loved
since the days of Titian and Van Dyck. Renoir, with his
love of the Old Masters, combined this tradition and his
Impressionist style. He created delightful portraits, which
were popular at once and gained wider understanding for
the Impressionists. Their art was still entirely misunderstood
in 1876, when this was painted. They were thought to be
incompetent daubers, incapable of &ldquo;finishing&rdquo; a picture
properly. But Renoir&rsquo;s extraordinarily deft handling of delicate
flesh tones, as in the child&rsquo;s face, and the radiance of
his coloring could silence such criticism.</p>
<p>By nature Renoir was too sympathetic with his fellow
man&mdash;and too charmed by the loveliness of women and
children&mdash;to be content with the strict limits of Monet&rsquo;s
Impressionism. Merely painting sensations of light in a landscape
did not satisfy the humanist Renoir. Once he showed
a friend a delicately tinted sketch of rose petals and told
him it was really a study for flesh tones. &ldquo;For me,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;a painting should be a lovable thing, gay and pretty; yes,
pretty. There are enough things to bore us in life without
our making more of them.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
